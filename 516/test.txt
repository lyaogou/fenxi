Last sunday, Mr.Lee got up very early to go £»¡¢£»¡¢£»fishing.
He spent the whole day sitting beside £»¡¢£»the river but got nothing at the end of the day.
Therefore, Mr.Lee¡®£»¡¯£¨* was very dissapointed due to that he had to go home by dinner time.
On his way home, Lee thought that£»¡¢£»¡¢ his wife might be mad at him for bringing nothing back. So he bought a big fish at the market before he got home¡¢.
At least, he was happy finally for what he could bring home.
